                <p>I am a full stack engineer and aviid gamer. Games are my passion and I bring that passion into my code.
                    Like in games, I strive to be adaptable with new technology and try to approach problems in different ways.
                    I try to make sure things are completed to satisfaction and most of all, I try to enjoy what I do.
